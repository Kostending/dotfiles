# Anders' Dotfiles

Dotfiles based on [Svends' dotfiles](https://github.com/svendcsvendsen/dotfiles). Though i added Spacemacs to it, at added my personal style here and there.

# Installing

First install [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick), [Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), Sublime Text 3, [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), and get the correct version of [emacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs).

Then link the dotfiles using the following commands:

	homesick clone kostending/dotfiles
	homesick symlink dotfiles

First time launching emacs, will take some time.
